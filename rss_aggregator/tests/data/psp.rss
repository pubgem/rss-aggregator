				<title>The good and bad of ambivalence: Desiring ambivalence under outcome uncertainty.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/_rhRNeKxYB0/493</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/493</guid>
				<description>Decades of past research point to the downside of evaluative inconsistency (i.e., ambivalence), suggesting that it is an unpleasant state that can result in negative affect. Consequently, people are often motivated to resolve their ambivalence in various ways. We propose that people sometimes desire to be ambivalent as a means of strategic self-protection. Across employment, educational and consumer choice settings, we demonstrate that when people are uncertain they can obtain a desired target, they will cultivate ambivalence in order to protect their feelings in the event that they fail to get what they want. Specifically, we show that people consciously desire to cultivate ambivalence as a way to emotionally hedge and that they seek out and process information in ways to deliberately cultivate ambivalence. We find that people are most likely to generate ambivalence when they are most uncertain that they can obtain their desired target. Depending on the outcome, this cultivated ambivalence can either be useful (when the desired target is not obtained) or backfire (when the desired target is obtained).

				<title>The voiced pronunciation of initial phonemes predicts the gender of names.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/fa0gMYVIoVg/509</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/509</guid>
				<description>Although it is known that certain names gain popularity within a culture because of historical events, it is unknown how names become associated with different social categories in the first place. We propose that vocal cord vibration during the pronunciation of an initial phoneme plays a critical role in explaining which names are assigned to males versus females. This produces a voiced gendered name effect, whereby voiced phonemes (vibration of the vocal cords) are more associated with male names, and unvoiced phonemes (no vibration of the vocal cords) are more associated with female names. Eleven studies test this association between voiced names and gender (a) using 270 million names (more than 80,000 unique names) given to children over 75 years, (b) names across 2 cultures (the U.S. and India), and (c) hundreds of novel names. The voiced gendered name effect was mediated through how hard or soft names sounded, and moderated by gender stereotype endorsement. Although extensive work has demonstrated morphological and physical cues to gender (e.g., facial, bodily, vocal), this work provides a systematic account of name-based cues to gender. Overall, the current research extends work on sound symbolism to names; the way in which a name sounds can be symbolically related to stereotypes associated with its social category.

				<title>On the psychological function of flags and logos: Group identity symbols increase perceived entitativity.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/8axMUWAgeY8/528</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/528</guid>
				<description>Group identity symbols such as flags and logos have been widely used across time and cultures, yet researchers know very little about the psychological functions that such symbols can serve. The present research tested the hypotheses that (a) simply having a symbol leads collections of individuals to seem more like real, unified groups, (b) this increased psychological realness leads groups to seem more threatening and effective to others, and (c) group members therefore strategically emphasize symbols when they want their group to appear unified and intimidating. In Studies 1a–1c, participants perceived various task groups as more entitative when they happened to have a symbol. In Study 2, symbols not only helped groups make up for lacking a physical characteristic associated with entitativity (physical similarity), but also led groups to seem more threatening. Study 3 examined the processes underlying this effect and found that group symbols increase entitativity by increasing perceived cohesiveness. Study 4 extended our results to show that symbols not only shape the impressions people form of novel groups, but also change people’s existing impressions of more familiar and real-world social groups, making them seem more entitative and competent but also less warm. Finally, Studies 5a and 5b further expand our understanding of the psychological function of symbols by showing that group members strategically display symbols when they are motivated to convey an impression of their group as unified and threatening (vs. inclusive and cooperative). We discuss implications for understanding how group members navigate their social identities.

				<title>Women selectively guard their (desirable) mates from ovulating women.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/NIT-9G7HOaE/551</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/551</guid>
				<description>For women, forming close, cooperative relationships with other women at once poses important opportunities and possible threats—including to mate retention. To maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of same-sex social relationships, we propose that women’s mate guarding is functionally flexible and that women are sensitive to both interpersonal and contextual cues indicating whether other women might be likely and effective mate poachers. Here, we assess one such cue: other women’s fertility. Because ovulating (i.e., high-fertility) women are both more attractive to men and also more attracted to (desirable) men, ovulating women may be perceived to pose heightened threats to other women’s romantic relationships. Across 4 experiments, partnered women were exposed to photographs of other women taken during either their ovulatory or nonovulatory menstrual-cycle phases, and consistently reported intentions to socially avoid ovulating (but not nonovulating) women—but only when their own partners were highly desirable. Exposure to ovulating women also increased women’s sexual desires for their (highly desirable) partners. These findings suggest that women can be sensitive to subtle cues of other women’s fertility and respond (e.g., via social exclusion, enhanced sexual attention to own mate) in ways that may facilitate their mate retention goals while not thwarting their affiliative goals.

				<title>Social responses to expressive suppression: The role of personality judgments.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/EgQ0tBZmoxg/574</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/574</guid>
				<description>Why do people who suppress their emotion-expressive behavior have difficulty forming close, supportive relationships? Previous studies have found that suppression disrupts the dynamics of social interactions and existing relationships. We evaluated a complementary hypothesis: that suppression functions as a behavioral cue leading others to form negative personality impressions of suppressors, even at zero-acquaintance. In 2 studies, participants reported personality judgments and other impressions of targets who either suppressed or expressed their emotion-expressive behavior in response to amusing or sad film clips. In findings replicated across studies, targets who suppressed either amusement or sadness were judged as less extraverted, less agreeable, and more interpersonally avoidant and anxious than targets who expressed emotions, and participants were less interested in affiliating with suppressors compared with expressers. Effects were amplified when targets suppressed amusement (compared with sadness) and when participants knew the emotional context (compared with when they did not) and, thus, could form expectations about what emotions targets should be showing. Extraversion and agreeableness judgments mediated the effect of suppression on participants’ disinterest in affiliating. In Study 2, which extended Study 1 in several ways, effects were pronounced for the enthusiasm aspect of extraversion and the compassion aspect of agreeableness. We also found evidence that judgments of suppressors do not simply fall between neutral and fully expressing targets; rather, judgments of suppressors are qualitatively different. We discuss implications for understanding the social consequences of emotion regulation—in particular, how beyond disrupting relationships, suppression may prevent some relationships from even forming in the first place.

				<title>"Close relationships and self-regulation: How relationship satisfaction facilitates momentary goal pursuit": Correction to Hofmann et al. (2015).</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/bTsy5kPzsFY/591</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/591</guid>
				<description>Reports an error in "Close relationships and self-regulation: How relationship satisfaction facilitates momentary goal pursuit" by Wilhelm Hofmann, Eli J. Finkel and Gráinne M. Fitzsimons (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2015[Sep], Vol 109[3], 434-452). In the article, Study 2: Experimental Manipulation of SRS, the Results section, the Hypothesis testing subsection, second sentence, an incorrect t value is reported. The t value reported t(193)=0.40, p .084 for the self-reported goal focus should have been t(193)=1.74, p=.084. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-28933-001.) In the new millennium, scholars have built a robust intersection between close-relationships research and self-regulation research. However, virtually no work has investigated how the most basic and broad indicator of relationship quality, relationship satisfaction, affects self-regulation and vice versa. In the present research, we show that higher relationship satisfaction promotes a motivational mind-set that is conducive for effective self-regulation, and thus for goal progress and performance. In Study 1—a large-scale, intensive experience sampling project of 115 couples (total N = 230)—we closely tracked fluctuations in state relationship satisfaction (SRS) and 4 parameters of effective self-regulation according to our conceptual model. Dyadic process analyses showed that individuals experiencing higher SRS than they typically do exhibited higher levels of (a) perceived control, (b) goal focus, (c) perceived partner support, and (d) positive affect during goal pursuit than they typically exhibit. Together, these 4 self-regulation-relevant variables translated into higher rates of daily progress on specific, idiographic goals. In Study 2 (N = 195), we employed a novel experimental manipulation of SRS, replicating the link between SRS and parameters of effective self-regulation. Taken together, these findings suggest that momentary increases in relationship satisfaction may benefit everyday goal pursuit through a combination of cognitive and affective mechanisms, thus further integrating relationship research with social–cognitive research on goal pursuit.

				<title>The development of global and domain-specific self-esteem from age 13 to 31.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/y_Yx1Or1iSw/592</link>

				<description>This study examines the development of global self-esteem and self-esteem in 6 specific domains across adolescence and young adulthood. Using a cohort-sequential design, we analyzed longitudinal data on 3,116 Norwegian men and women from 13 to 31 years of age by means of growth curve modeling. Questionnaire data provided information on global self-esteem and self-esteem in social, academic, athletic, and appearance domains. Data on important life outcomes was provided by register linkages. Results showed increasing levels of global self-esteem and self-esteem in most domains with increasing age. Being male, higher parental education, and reported higher levels of parental care were related to higher levels of global self-esteem and self-esteem in several domains. Self-esteem in the appearance domain showed high and stable correlations with global self-esteem, whereas in social domains, correlations with global self-esteem increased over age, with a particularly steep increase for romantic appeal self-esteem. As to the prospective relationship between self-esteem and important life outcomes, results showed that participants high in academic self-esteem attained higher education levels and higher income, but most of the relationship was explained by covariates such as parents’ socioeconomic status and school grades. Low global self-esteem predicted later prescription of antidepressants, even after controlling for covariates. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive picture of the development of global and domain-specific self-esteem throughout adolescence and young adulthood using long-term longitudinal data. The results underscore the importance of examining development of self-esteem in specific domains in addition to global self-esteem.

				<title>Changing the personality of a face: Perceived Big Two and Big Five personality factors modeled in real photographs.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/rOKu5iTHGXU/609</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/609</guid>
				<description>General, spontaneous evaluations of strangers based on their faces have been shown to reflect judgments of these persons’ intention and ability to harm. These evaluations can be mapped onto a 2D space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness (intention) and dominance (ability). Here we go beyond general evaluations and focus on more specific personality judgments derived from the Big Two and Big Five personality concepts. In particular, we investigate whether Big Two/Big Five personality judgments can be mapped onto the 2D space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness and dominance. Results indicate that judgments of the Big Two personality dimensions almost perfectly map onto the 2D space. In contrast, at least 3 of the Big Five dimensions (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness) go beyond the 2D space, indicating that additional dimensions are necessary to describe more specific face-based personality judgments accurately. Building on this evidence, we model the Big Two/Big Five personality dimensions in real facial photographs. Results from 2 validation studies show that the Big Two/Big Five are perceived reliably across different samples of faces and participants. Moreover, results reveal that participants differentiate reliably between the different Big Two/Big Five dimensions. Importantly, this high level of agreement and differentiation in personality judgments from faces likely creates a subjective reality which may have serious consequences for those being perceived—notably, these consequences ensue because the subjective reality is socially shared, irrespective of the judgments’ validity. The methodological approach introduced here might prove useful in various psychological disciplines.

				<title>Spousal similarity in life satisfaction before and after divorce.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/vLhvvCnBU3g/625</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/625</guid>
				<description>Previous research has explored possible origins of individual differences in subjective well-being, focusing largely on stable, internal characteristics of traits as predictors of life satisfaction (Diener &amp; Lucas, 1999). Although past work has demonstrated that life satisfaction is largely stable over the life span, other evidence has also demonstrated the lasting impact of life events. In this study, we use married couples as a test of the impact of life circumstances on life satisfaction, focusing on similarity in life satisfaction before and after divorce. If life satisfaction is impacted by shared life circumstances, married couples (who share life circumstances) should show greater similarity in life satisfaction before divorce than after. We tested this possibility using a dyadic latent-state-trait model that examined cross-spouse similarity in the stable and changing components of life satisfaction. Using a nationally representative panel study from Germany (Wagner, Frick &amp; Schupp, 2007), we showed that similarity declined substantially following divorce. This suggests that life satisfaction is related to shared life circumstances.

				<title>"People underestimate the value of persistence for creative performance": Correction to Lucas and Nordgren (2015).</title>

				<description>Reports an error in "People underestimate the value of persistence for creative performance" by Brian J. Lucas and Loran F. Nordgren (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2015[Aug], Vol 109[2], 232-243). In the article, there are misaligned headers and incorrect means and standard deviations for the first six columns in Table 2 due to a production error. The corrected table is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-31619-002.) Across 7 studies, we investigated the prediction that people underestimate the value of persistence for creative performance. Across a range of creative tasks, people consistently underestimated how productive they would be while persisting (Studies 1–3). Study 3 found that the subjectively experienced difficulty, or disfluency, of creative thought accounted for persistence undervaluation. Alternative explanations based on idea quality (Studies 1–2B) and goal setting (Study 4) were considered and ruled out and domain knowledge was explored as a boundary condition (Study 5). In Study 6, the disfluency of creative thought reduced people’s willingness to invest in an opportunity to persist, resulting in lower financial performance. This research demonstrates that persistence is a critical determinant of creative performance and that people may undervalue and underutilize persistence in everyday creative problem solving.

				<title>The moral foundations hypothesis does not replicate well in Black samples.</title> 
				<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/apa-journals-psp/~3/LLstYHBc9U4/e23</link>
				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/e23</guid>
				<description>The current study examined the generalizability of the moral foundations hypothesis (Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 2009), which predicts that conservatism will be positively related to the binding foundations (i.e., virtues of ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity). Religiosity has been consistently linked with the binding foundations in predominately White samples, but Black people in the United States are both more religious and more liberal than White people. In a sample of college students (N = 693; 58.3% Black, 41.7% White), examination of measurement invariance suggested metric, but not scalar invariance. The relationship between conservatism and the binding foundations—specifically, respect/authority and purity/sanctity—was weaker in Black people than in White people. These results were replicated in a second sample (N = 490; 63.5% Black, 36.5% White) using a 4-item measure of conservatism rather than a single item. Once again examination of measurement invariance suggested metric but not scalar invariance, and conservatism was more weakly related to the binding foundations in Black people than it was in White people. Implications for future theory and research are discussed.
