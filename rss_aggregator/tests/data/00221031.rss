A series of three experiments examined the extent to which variations in the moral framing of pro-environmental messaging affect liberals' vs. conservatives' conservation intentions, climate change attitudes, and donations to an environmental organization. While liberals did not generally differ across conditions, conservatives shifted substantially in the pro-environmental direction after exposure to a binding moral frame, in which protecting the natural environment was portrayed as a matter of obeying authority, defending the purity of nature, and demonstrating one's patriotism to the United States. This shift was pronounced when conservatives perceived the congruent appeal to be a stronger argument. Evidence of mediated moderation is also presented, in which the attitudinal and behavioral shifts for conservatives were a function of the degree to which the values present in the pro-environmental appeal were perceived as coming from the ingroup. Discussion focuses on future directions for more precisely specifying moral framing effects, and on considering the pros and cons of targeted messaging for the sustainability of environmental attitude change.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116301056%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dc1a1cf6cefd654802f0ff504918e293d</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Just you and I: The role of social exclusion in the formation of interpersonal relationships</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116301123%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D36400f7f1e026f2c68af75fe2dfbdbf4</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Natalie A.

Although the negative effects of exclusion on its recipients are undisputed, we suggest that it may have unrecognized benefits for those who perpetuate it. The present research investigated the possibility that social exclusion acts as a signal to others – either within or outside of an exclusive interaction – that a selected relationship is particularly cohesive. Participants interacted in triads in which one individual was or was not singled out for exclusion. Perpetrators of exclusion were perceived (by themselves and by the excluded person) as closer and more similar to each other, and were more likely to be subject to source memory confusions. These findings suggest that social exclusion has not only harmful consequences for its targets, but may have relational benefits for those who enact it.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116301123%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D36400f7f1e026f2c68af75fe2dfbdbf4</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Incomplete professional identity goals override moral concerns</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116301469%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2455120854e1d3b721ed3001fad5d025</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Michael K.

When the completeness of an identity goal becomes threatened, people are driven to engage in self-symbolizing to compensate. In two studies, we found that committed individuals endorsed immoral behaviors displayed by professional businessmen (Study 1) and lawyers (Study 2) after having received bogus negative feedback about their aptitude for the respective profession. When high school seniors committed to pursuing a STEM profession received bogus negative (vs. positive) feedback on possessing relevant cognitive abilities (Study 3), they were observed to selfascribe personality traits associated with professional success but also with engaging in immoral behavior. Strategies for ameliorating negative compensation behavior, differences from general self-affirmation, and implications for understanding immoral behavior are discussed.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116301469%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2455120854e1d3b721ed3001fad5d025</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Affective responses to ambivalence are context-dependent: A facial EMG study on the role of inconsistency and evaluative context in shaping affective responses to ambivalence</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116300713%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D5087a3bb373073dcd9fc7925519d3b13</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Hannah U.

Using facial EMG, we tested the idea that affective responses to ambivalence are dependent on the inconsistency of evaluations in the current situation. In a person perception task, participants were presented with positive (e.g., friendly, intelligent), negative (e.g., jealous, dominant), or positive and negative information (e.g., intelligent, dominant) about different target persons. When participants were only exposed to the information without having to respond, ambivalent information elicited the same affective response as positive stimuli, participants showed more zygomaticus (positive affect) and less corrugator activation (negative affect) than to negative stimuli (task 1). When participants had to make a choice, ambivalent information elicited the same affective response as negative information (task 2). This was qualified by the possibility to resolve the inconsistency between evaluations. Specifically, ambivalence only led to a relative decrease in positive affect when evaluative context did not help resolve the inconsistency between ambivalent evaluations and created a choice conflict (e.g., “Bob is intelligent and dominant. Do you think Bob is a good collaborator?”). When the same ambivalent information (e.g. “Bob is intelligent and dominant”) was presented in a context in which the opposing evaluations were not inconsistent (e.g., “Do you think Bob can write a good research paper?”), participants reported to experience lower levels of conflict and displayed more positive affect (i.e., more zygomaticus activation). The current data contribute to the reconciliation of previously inconclusive results on affective responses to attitudinal ambivalence. The results suggest that ambivalence only leads to relatively more negative affect (i.e., a decrease in positive affect) when ambivalent information is inconsistent in a current situation and thus creates conflict. Implications of these findings are discussed.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116300713%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D5087a3bb373073dcd9fc7925519d3b13</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Partisan underestimation of the polarizing influence of group discussion</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116301457%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De8628366d0d11cf23f0603b26391296b</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Jessica   Keating, Leaf   Van Boven, Charles M.

We hypothesized that people underestimate how much a relatively brief group discussion polarizes their own attitudes. People often perceive their own attitudes as unbiased and stable over time. Therefore, people's polarized post-discussion attitudes may cause them to misremember their pre-discussion attitudes as having been more extreme than they were. In two experiments, participants engaged in 15-minute discussions with 4–6 like-minded others regarding two political topics: whether Barack Obama or George W. Bush was the better president (Experiment 1) and whether they supported Barack Obama or Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential election (Experiment 2). Group discussion polarized participants' attitudes, and participants misremembered their pre-discussion attitudes as having been more extreme than they actually were. Participants' polarized post-discussion attitudes significantly predicted their recalled pre-discussion attitudes, controlling for their actual pre-discussion attitudes, suggesting that their post-discussion attitudes guided reconstruction of their pre-discussion attitudes. These findings have implications for people's awareness of psychological biases and for the societal effects of partisan enclavement.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116301457%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De8628366d0d11cf23f0603b26391296b</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Keep in touch: The effects of imagined touch support on stress and exploration</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116302013%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df06001270ff04805688f0b7085fa051e</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Brittany K.

A parallel approach, in which prospective imagery is used to concretely imagine other's scenarios, may similarly reduce social discounting (i.e., enhance altruism). In study 1, participants engaged in episodic thinking about the self or others, in a repeated-measures design, while completing a social discounting task. Reductions in social discounting were observed as a function of episodic thinking about others, though an interaction with order was also observed. Using an independent-measures design in study 2, the effect of episodic thinking about others was replicated. Study 3 addressed a limitation of studies 1 and 2, the possibility that simply thinking about others decreased social discounting. Capitalizing on Construal Level Theory, which specifies that social distance and time in the future are both dimensions of a common psychological distance, we hypothesized that episodic future thinking should also decrease social discounting. Participants engaged in episodic future thinking or episodic present thinking, in a repeated-measures design, while completing a social discounting task. The pattern of results was similar to study 1, providing support for the notion that episodic thinking about psychologically distant outcomes (for others or in the future) reduces social discounting. Application of similar episodic thinking approaches may enhance altruism.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS002210311630169X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D05fc6694422d0c26ee5c22f6b6d2ed37</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Making it moral: Merely labeling an attitude as moral increases its strength</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116302372%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D50e56160b41fe80c0afdbfccb0f1770c</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Andrew   Luttrell, Richard E.

Although previous studies typically rely on self-report measures of such bases, the present research tests the possibility that people can be induced to view their own attitudes as grounded in moral bases. This perception alone leads to outcomes associated with strong attitudes. In three experiments, participants were led to view their attitudes as grounded in moral or non-moral bases. Merely perceiving a moral (vs. non-moral) basis to one's attitudes led them to show greater correspondence with relevant behavioral intentions (Experiment 1) and become less susceptible to change following a persuasive message (Experiments 2 and 3). Moreover, these effects were independent of any other established indicators of attitude strength.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116302372%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D50e56160b41fe80c0afdbfccb0f1770c</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Costly third-party interventions: The role of incidental anger and attention focus in punishment of the perpetrator and compensation of the victim</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116302360%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db33ff14717c342b7f6ff4b28a633637a</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Michaela   Gummerum, Lotte F.

This research investigated the cognitive and emotional processes underlying two types of costly third-party interventions by manipulating incidental emotions and attention focus. In Study 1, we investigated the effect of incidental anger on third-party punishment decisions. Study 2 addressed the effect of incidental anger on third-party compensation decisions. In both studies, participants were induced to either an angry or neutral emotion and then had to wait or were distracted before engaging in third-party interventions. In Study 1, angry participants punished highly unequal distributions significantly more than those in the neutral emotion condition. In Study 2, angry participants compensated highly unfair distributions significantly less than those in a neutral emotion. In both studies, the effect of incidental anger was only significant in the wait, not the distraction condition. Study 3 again focused on third-party compensation decisions. Participants were induced to either a self-focused anger or an other-focused anger emotion, and attention focus (wait, distraction) was manipulated experimentally. Those in the other-focused anger condition compensated significantly more than participants in the self-focused anger condition. These results indicate that (self-focused) incidental anger led to antagonistic responses. Incidental anger was only associated with higher third-party compensation when it included a focus on a suffering other. For incidental emotions to bias subsequent decisions requires attentional resources.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116302360%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db33ff14717c342b7f6ff4b28a633637a</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Disentangling sunk-costs and completion proximity: The role of regulatory focus</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS002210311630244X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8b7f394cbafe48332cd7ef85c3d7e32b</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Adam P.

Existing research shows that people tend to escalate when prior expenditures (e.g., sunk costs) are high, whereas other research suggests that people tend to escalate when a project nears completion, regardless of prior expenditures. In this paper, we argue that decision-makers have diverse goals driven by regulatory foci that represent alternative motivations for escalation. Specifically, people who regulate their behaviour towards achieving gains (i.e., a promotion focus) are influenced more strongly by proximity to project completion than those who focus on the presence or absence of losses (i.e., a prevention focus). Across empirical studies using different operationalizations of regulatory focus, we show that increased promotion focus, but not prevention focus, exacerbates escalation behaviour as a project nears completion. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for individual motivations when designing interventions to curb escalation behaviour.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS002210311630244X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8b7f394cbafe48332cd7ef85c3d7e32b</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Laughter conveys status</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116302359%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dd5d73c44fe8964a8329c261d6db00a1f</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Christopher   Oveis, Aleksandr   Spectre, Pamela K.

In Study 1, naturally occurring laughter was observed while low- and high-status individuals teased one another. The use of dominant and submissive laughter corresponded to hierarchical variables: High-status individuals and teasers displayed more dominant, disinhibited laughs, whereas low-status individuals and targets of teases displayed more submissive, inhibited laughs. Further, low-status individuals were more likely to vary the form of their laughter between contexts than high-status individuals. Study 2 demonstrated that laughter influences perceptions of status by naïve observers. Individuals who laughed dominantly were afforded higher status than individuals who laughed submissively, regardless of their actual status. Moreover, low-status laughers were perceived to be significantly higher in status, and to have as much status as high-status laughers, when laughing dominantly versus submissively. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that the positive emotional reactions of observers of laughter can help explain the link between laugh type and status perceptions.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116302359%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dd5d73c44fe8964a8329c261d6db00a1f</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>A burden for the boys: Evidence of stereotype threat in boys' reading performance</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116301202%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dfcf31a8202f98b1985c09d4a1397acd1</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>July 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 65</br><br>     Author(s): Pascal   Pansu, Isabelle   Régner, Sylvain   Max, Pascale   Colé, John B.

This is surprising as the gender gap in reading is three times bigger than the gender gap in math (OECD, 2014). In this study, we examined whether ST may explain gender differences favoring schoolgirls in reading, assuming that boys are negatively stereotyped in this domain. Eighty students (3rd grade) took a reading test while being assigned to either a threat or a reduced-threat condition (test presented as diagnostic of reading abilities versus as a game, respectively). Boys underperformed girls in the threat condition, whereas they outperformed girls in the reduced-threat condition. Consistent with ST theory, this pattern was obtained only among highly-identified students.

However, such findings appear inconsistent with general principles arising from the justice literature, which implies that people should feel <italic>satisfaction</italic> when they perceive that transgressors have been punished for their misdeeds. In this paper, we use a variety of different measures of affect (mood, linguistic analyses, direct ratings of emotional reactions) to show that revenge is capable of producing both negative (“bitter”) and favorable (“sweet”) reactions. In particular, we find support for a <italic>bittersweet</italic> model of revenge, in that such acts concurrently elicit genuinely positive appraisals, over and above the elicitation of negative affect. We consider the implications of our research for a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of revenge.</simple-para> <simple-para id="sp0075" view="all">Does revenge make people feel good, or bad? Some research appears to support the former proposition, in line with intuition about the “sweetness” of revenge (de Quervain et al., 2004; Funk, McGeer, &amp;amp; Gollwitzer, 2014; Gollwitzer, Meder, &amp;amp; Schmitt, 2011). Other researchers support the latter, asserting that revenge can make people feel <italic>worse</italic> than they otherwise would (Carlsmith, Wilson, &amp;amp; Gilbert, 2008; Lambert, Eadeh, Peak, Scherer, Schott, et al., 2014; Lambert, Peak, Eadeh and Schott, 2014). In this article we show that both perspectives are correct. In particular, revenge can elicit positive <italic>as well as</italic> negative sentiments, but the extent to which such reactions are evident depends on how affect is operationalized. Along with resolving an apparent contradiction in the literature, we offer a more nuanced perspective on the hedonic consequences of revenge, one that allows for the existence of negative (“bitter”) as well as positive (“sweet”) reactions to such acts.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116302554%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D489917d3c535c7edffb8dad7a09c995f</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Editorial Board</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116000093%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df020921f8b8fe5131f4ce623cda4afbe</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>May 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 64</br><br></br><br><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116000093%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df020921f8b8fe5131f4ce623cda4afbe</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Atlas Research</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS002210311600010X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db490ca06dd0faa416bae8c407ccf49a6</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>May 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 64</br><br></br><br><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS002210311600010X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db490ca06dd0faa416bae8c407ccf49a6</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>On incidental catalysts of elaboration: Reminders of environmental structure promote effortful thought</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116300014%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4bc196b81fd71820b93cc6bbafa3ee63</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>May 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 64</br><br>     Author(s): Ryan   Rahinel, Nelson Borges   Amaral, Joshua J.

In response, this research tests whether a more fundamental, incidental feature of the environment—structure—might influence the extent to which individuals engage in elaboration. Three studies demonstrate that incidental reminders of structure increase elaboration (Experiment 1), which in turn impacts individuals' confidence in their choice (Experiment 2) as well as the choice itself (Experiment 3). Collectively, the findings offer novel insight into the role of structure in promoting elaboration, and suggest that structure-seeking may be functional in part because it leads to more thoughtful, considered judgments and decisions.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116300014%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4bc196b81fd71820b93cc6bbafa3ee63</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Prayer, self-affirmation, and distraction improve recovery from short-term ostracism</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116300026%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D90173f8d4d9e3995f406c1ebfd729429</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>May 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 64</br><br>     Author(s): Andrew H.

Whereas the immediate effects of ostracism tend to be resistant to moderation, people differ in how quickly they recover. Here we investigated three strategies that may promote recovery from ostracism: prayer, self-affirmation, and distraction. In three experiments we found that all three interventions lead to greater recovery of basic needs satisfaction than a control condition in which participants were allowed to naturally ruminate. While all three interventions lead to a similar amount of recovery, only the effects of distraction condition were mediated by reductions in rumination, suggesting that prayer and self-affirmation promote recovery, but do so through mechanisms other than distraction. In addition, we found that religious commitment to God was associated with greater recovery following prayer, but not self-affirmation. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116300026%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D90173f8d4d9e3995f406c1ebfd729429</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Will you remember me?

In the present research we examined the consequences of this cultural difference for own-group face recognition biases. In Study 1, European Canadians and first-generation East Asian Canadians were assigned to minimal groups. Consistent with previous findings, European Canadians showed superior memory for own-group faces; however, as expected, first-generation East Asian Canadians did not. In Study 2, using university affiliation as the experimentally manipulated social group, European Canadians again showed superior memory for own-group faces, whereas first-generation East Asian Canadians did not. The results are consistent with current theorizing and suggest that the effect of mere social categorization on face recognition is moderated by culture.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116300099%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2002ad1e15a80a53ece2b0f1e2156feb</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Promote up, ingratiate down: Status comparisons drive warmth-competence tradeoffs in impression management</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS002210311630018X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dc70dd35a9d83da7b0c6762ccd94ce53b</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>May 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 64</br><br>     Author(s): Jillian K.

Because both outcomes are dissatisfying, we propose that these people are motivated to avoid prosocial requests, even when they face these requests in private, anonymous contexts. In two experiments, in which participants' anonymity and privacy was assured, participants avoided facing prosocial requests and were willing to do so at a personal cost. This was true both for people who would have otherwise complied with the request and those who would have otherwise refused the request. This suggests that anticipatory self-reproach motivates people to avoid prosocial requests, regardless of whether or not this self-reproach would have been strong enough to cause them to comply with a direct request.

One way for individuals to respond to negative feedback from a group may thus be to adjust their perceptions of the group's homogeneity, enabling them to dismiss the feedback as unreliable. We show that individuals appreciate this logic (Study 1) and that they put it to strategic use by regarding the members of a group as more homogenous when the group judges them negatively than when it judges them positively (Studies 2, 3, and 4).

The present research examined a downstream consequence of this effect, namely, whether causal uncertainty activates a goal to think more abstractly. We drew on principles of goal activation, to show that after leading participants to feel more uncertain about a negative event, they were more likely to resume an experience that afforded an opportunity to think more abstractly (i.e., focusing on similarities rather than differences; Experiments 1A and 1B). In further support of our motivational framework, we also show that after leading participants to feel more uncertain about a negative event, they no longer exhibited a more positive attitude toward an experience that afforded an opportunity to think more abstractly once they had the opportunity to actually engage in more abstract thinking (Experiment 2).

According to dominant theories in this area, a key to understanding the effects of ownership is the mental association between the owner and the owned object. However, little is known about the formation of such associations. Drawing on principles of associative network theories, the present research investigated the effects of two types of ownership situations, mere-ownership and ownership-by-choice, on implicit self-object linking (i.e., the behavior of automatically connecting a person's self and a given object on an implicit measure). In Study 1, mere-ownership influenced implicit self-object linking for positive, but not for negative, objects. In Study 2, ownership of negative objects influenced implicit self-object linking in ownership-by-choice but not mere-ownership situations. Studies 3 to 5 replicated the effect of ownership-by-choice on implicit self-object linking for negative objects and further demonstrated its independence of pre-existing differences in relevant object properties, ownership expectations, and physical ownership.

Results revealed that responsive targets were rated more favorably following exposure to unresponsive targets, regardless of level of attractiveness.

These results highlight the importance of the context in which dating decisions are made.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116300737%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db1c7ab1037e52e5ba28bbc0673bf3509</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Promise, peril, and perspective: Addressing concerns about reproducibility in social–personality psychology</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116000020%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D9648a926341590c7fe6b693aebf8441d</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>Available online 1 April 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</br><br>     Author(s): Harry T.

In the present paper, I propose an alternative system for conducting rigorous and replicable psychological investigations, which I describe as Exploring Small, Confirming Big. I begin with a critical evaluation of the merits of NHST and small-scale meta-analyses, and argue that NHST does have a valuable role in the scientific process, whereas small-scale meta-analyses will do little to advance a cumulative science. I then present an overview of an alternative system for producing cumulative and replicable psychological research: Exploring Small, Confirming Big. It involves a two-step process to psychological research, consisting of (1) small <italic>N</italic> investigation(s), in which psychologists use NHST to develop exploratory models; and (2) strong, confirmatory tests of exploratory models, by analyzing new and/or existing large <italic>N</italic> datasets with variables that capture the effect(s) of interest from the Exploring Small stage.

To reflect this understanding, we collected and summarized the existing literature on replications and combined it into a comprehensive overall typology that simplifies and restructures existing approaches. The resulting typology depicts how multiple, hierarchically structured replication studies guide the integration of laboratory and field research and advance theory. It can be applied to (a) evaluate a theory's current status, (b) guide researchers' decisions, (c) analyze and argue for the necessity of certain types of replication studies, and (d) assess the added value of a replication study at a given state of knowledge. We conclude with practical recommendations for different protagonists in the field (e.g., authors, reviewers, editors, and funding agencies).

The current replication crisis is particularly severe because (1) psychologists are questioning the accuracy of findings rather than the meaning of findings, and (2) researchers are responding to real scientific failures, rather than hypothetical scientific failures. I present an expanded model of statistical decision making that can be used to help researchers draw more reliable conclusions. Based on the premise that drawing conclusions on relatively bad evidence is an error, Type III and IV errors are introduced as categories representing statistical decisions that align with reality, but do not follow from the available evidence. Treating these as errors helps researchers and evaluators of research to draw more reliable conclusions. From the perspective of this model I discuss procedures that researchers can use to not only produce more replicable results, but also conduct more powerful statistical tests.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001213%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D5de0760a3ead9b31bfd6646083d86323</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Design approaches to experimental mediation</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001225%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4b10a5072a1fb99ee3f86d3f60b6302f</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>Available online 24 March 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</br><br>     Author(s): Angela G.

Commonly, studies in experimental social psychology randomly assign participants to levels of the independent variable and measure the mediating and dependent variables, and the mediator is assumed to causally affect the dependent variable. However, participants are not randomly assigned to levels of the mediating variable(s), i.e., the relationship between the mediating and dependent variables is correlational. Although researchers likely know that correlational studies pose a risk of confounding, this problem seems forgotten when thinking about experimental designs randomly assigning participants to levels of the independent variable and measuring the mediator (i.e., “measurement-of-mediation” designs). Experimentally manipulating the mediator provides an approach to solving these problems, yet these methods contain their own set of challenges (e.g., <cross-ref refid="bb0015" id="cf0035">Bullock, Green, &amp;amp; Ha, 2010</cross-ref>). We describe types of experimental manipulations targeting the mediator (manipulations demonstrating a causal effect of the mediator on the dependent variable and manipulations targeting the strength of the causal effect of the mediator) and types of experimental designs (double randomization, concurrent double randomization, and parallel), provide published examples of the designs, and discuss the strengths and challenges of each design. Therefore, the goals of this paper include providing a practical guide to manipulation-of-mediator designs in light of their challenges and encouraging researchers to use more rigorous approaches to mediation because manipulation-of-mediator designs strengthen the ability to infer causality of the mediating variable on the dependent variable.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001225%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4b10a5072a1fb99ee3f86d3f60b6302f</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>How to publish rigorous experiments in the 21st century</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103116000032%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Da57e226af6138a88a58ec3b448a98a38</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>Available online 24 March 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</br><br>     Author(s): Susan T.

Ioannidis´ claim is valid only for one-shot studies without replication and with a low a priori probability that the tested hypothesis is true. Mass replication provides limited information about the validity of social psychological research, because failures to replicate do not prove that the original finding is invalid.

We employ several well-known and cross-cutting examples from the psychological literature to illustrate how, independent (or in the absence) of replicability difficulties or questionable research practices leading to false positives, motivated reasoning and confirmation biases can lead to drawing unjustified conclusions. In describing these examples, we review strategies and methods by which researchers can identify such practices in their own and others' research reports. These strategies and methods can unmask hidden phenomena that may conflict with researchers' preferred narratives, in order to ultimately produce more sound and valid scientific conclusions. We conclude with general recommendations for how social psychologists can limit the influence of interpretive biases in their own and others' research, and thereby elevate the scientific status and validity of social psychology.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115300032%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D0fa95ac0ed98ee153f6370fcc49605ed</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Can we turn shirkers into workers?</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001201%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D80fd28a322ca4c2b136993f3f9577279</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>Available online 24 March 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</br><br>     Author(s): Adam J.

Once inattentive respondents are identified, however, researchers must decide whether to drop such respondents, thus threatening external validity, or keep such respondents, thus threatening internal validity. In this article, we ask whether there is a third way: can inattentive respondents be induced to pay attention? Using three different strategies across three studies, we show that while such inducements increase attention check passage, they do not reduce noise in descriptive or experimental survey items. In addition, the inducements cause some respondents to drop out of the survey. These results have important implications for applied research. While scholars should continue to measure inattention via attention checks, increasing the attentiveness of “shirker” respondents is not as easy as previously thought.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001201%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D80fd28a322ca4c2b136993f3f9577279</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>The pipeline project: Pre-publication independent replications of a single laboratory's research pipeline</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115300019%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2f12002c868789f641c5dbf509b06924</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>Available online 24 March 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</br><br>     Author(s): Martin   Schweinsberg, Nikhil   Madan, Michelangelo   Vianello, S.

To illustrate the Pre-Publication Independent Replication (PPIR) approach, 25 research groups conducted replications of all ten moral judgment effects which the last author and his collaborators had “in the pipeline” as of August 2014. Six findings replicated according to all replication criteria, one finding replicated but with a significantly smaller effect size than the original, one finding replicated consistently in the original culture but not outside of it, and two findings failed to find support. In total, 40% of the original findings failed at least one major replication criterion.

Conceptual replications value confidence in theory; their use tends to favor rapid progress over ferreting out error.

Field methods sometimes are characterized by features – relatively high levels of participant diversity, relative lack of control over extraneous variables, greater focus on behavioral dependent variables, less room for researcher degrees of freedom, and lower likelihood of publication bias – that can increase the veracity and robustness of published research. Moreover, field studies can help extend psychological research in valuable ways to applied domains such as health, law, education, and business. Consequently, field studies, especially those that integrate an applied perspective, can provide information directly relevant for tackling important social problems.

Building on Sakaluk's (in this issue) distinction between exploration and confirmation, I argue that this shift will increase correctness of findings, but at the expense of exploration and discovery. The likely effects on the field include aversion to risk, increased difficulty in building careers and hence more capricious hiring and promotion policies, loss of interdisciplinary influence, and rising interest in small, weak findings. Winners (who stand to gain from the mooted changes) include researchers with the patience and requisite resources to assemble large samples; incompetent experimenters; destructive iconoclasts; competing subfields of psychology; and lower-ranked journals, insofar as they publish creative work with small samples. The losers are young researchers; writers of literature reviews and textbooks; flamboyant, creative researchers with lesser levels of patience; and researchers at small colleges. My position is that the field has actually done quite well in recent decades, and improvement should be undertaken as further refinement of a successful approach, in contrast to the Cassandrian view that the field's body of knowledge is hopelessly flawed and radical, revolutionary change is needed. I recommend we retain the exploratory research approach alongside the new, large-sample confirmatory work.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS002210311600007X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2c4c6b7db4b459b993c14434893f4bcf</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Editorial Board</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001390%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dc78e074d7c117f676b83db685105db62</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>March 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 63</br><br></br><br><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001390%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dc78e074d7c117f676b83db685105db62</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>ATLAS_RESEARCH</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001407%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D587d98d236b5f008408b7ceaece75490</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>March 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 63</br><br></br><br><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115001407%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D587d98d236b5f008408b7ceaece75490</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Instructing implicit processes: When instructions to approach or avoid influence implicit but not explicit evaluation</title> <link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115300147%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dac3cb877b62d559c26205a2017dcb3ba</link> <description><![CDATA[             Publication date: <pubDate>March 2016</pubDate><br> <b>Source:</b>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 63</br><br>     Author(s): Pieter   Van Dessel, Jan   De Houwer, Anne   Gast, Colin Tucker   Smith, Maarten   De Schryver</br><br><abstract-sec xmlns:ns2="http://webservices.elsevier.com/schemas/search/fast/types/v4" xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" id="as0005" view="all"> <simple-para id="sp0035" view="all">Previous research has shown that linking approach or avoidance actions to novel stimuli through mere instructions causes changes in the implicit evaluation of these stimuli even when the actions are never performed.

Study 1 addressed this possibility by focusing on whether I-sharing (but not Me-sharing) promotes greater willingness to share a desired good. After interacting with three ostensible partners (an I-sharer, a Me-sharer, and a Not Similar Other), participants indicated their liking for each of these partners and distributed a desired good between themselves and each partner. Although participants reported higher liking for both the I-sharer and the Me-sharer than for the dissimilar other, when it came to the allocation of the desired good, they showed generosity only to the I-sharer. Study 2 addressed questions lingering from Study 1 by manipulating I-sharing and Me-sharing in a between participants design, by equalizing the importance of the I-sharing and Me-sharing dimensions, and by looking at a separate indicator of selflessness (i.e., helping intentions). Results conceptually replicated those of Study 1, with participants reporting significantly higher helping intentions when they I-shared with their partner than when they Me-shared with their partner (even though participants reported equivalent levels of liking in both partner conditions).

However, whether a similar action–omission effect applies to judgments of praiseworthiness of positive outcomes is still an open question. Drawing on positive–negative asymmetries found in other domains, we hypothesized that positive events would not elicit an action–omission effect for judgments of praise, because such positive events do not by default trigger the causal appraisal processes that are central to the action–omission effect. Furthermore, we posited that when people are explicitly asked to consider causality before or during the judgment, an action–omission effect on judgments of praise could be obtained too. These hypotheses were verified in three independent studies and a meta-analytic analysis. As such, the present set of studies provides novel insights in the action–omission effect's asymmetry for negative and positive outcomes, as well as an increased understanding of the role of causality appraisal in this effect: judgments of praise are less reliant on causal reasoning than judgments of blame, and therefore also less susceptible to the action–omission bias.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>]]></description> <feedDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 02:28:07 GMT</feedDate> <guid>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0022103115300172%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D290178102a899e45b77c8e65acd7b2e3</guid> <dc:date>2016-05-23T02:28:07Z</dc:date> </item> </channel> </rss>
